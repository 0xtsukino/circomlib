# Library of Circom Templates

This is the library of templates of [`circom`](https://github.com/iden3/circom), a circuit compiler for zero-knowledge circuits. 

## Table of Contents

- [`circuits`](circuits) : it contains several circom circuit templates to perform different kinds of operations. From more basic ones, like comparing two numbers or doing binary arithmetic, to more complex functions, such as elliptic curve operations, validating digital signatures or hashing.
- [`doc`](doc) : documentation about some of the more complicated circuits. It contains some Markdown files and some circuit schemes in ASCII. The latter must be opened with Monodraw, an ASCII art editor for Mac.
- [`src`](src) : utils written in JavaScript for deploying contracts. These files are used in some tests.
