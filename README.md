## Table of Contents

- [`circuits`](circuits) : it contains several circom circuit templates to perform different kinds of operations, from more basic ones, for example comparison of two numbers or conversions from numbers to its binary representation, to more complex functions, such as elliptic curve operations, hash functions or digital signatures.
- [`doc`](doc) : documentation about some of the more complicated circuits. There are markdown files and some circuit schemes in ASCII, the latter must be opened with Monodraw, an ASCII art editor for Mac.
