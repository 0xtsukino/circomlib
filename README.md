# Library of Circom Templates

This is the library of templates of [`circom`](https://github.com/iden3/circom), a circuit compiler for zero-knowledge circuits. 

<!-- 
## Organisation (old)

This respository contains 5 folders:
- `circuits`: it contains the implementation of different cryptographic primitives in circom language.
- `calcpedersenbases`: set of functions in JavaScript used to find a set of points in [Baby Jubjub](https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/baby_jubjub) elliptic curve that serve as basis for the [Pedersen Hash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2234).
- `doc`: it contains some circuit schemes in ASCII (must be opened with Monodraw, an ASCII art editor for Mac).

A description of the specific circuit templates for the `circuit` folder will be soon updated.
